brief description:

    Textbook Query Processor branched from a Research Prototype:
    - Dynamic programming join optimizer (DPSize) with filters being pushed down
    - Execution Engine using push-based pipelining with batches and different memory-efficient hash joins
    - Task-based parallelization
    - Mid-query re-optimization to compensate cardinality estimation errors


third party code:
    - none
